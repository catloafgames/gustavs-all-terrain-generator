# Gustav's All Terrain Generator
This is a terrain generator for valheim. It ouputs a list of commands to be run by replay (a comfy staff mod by redseiko)

It takes any heightmap, and is designed to have a series of configurable parameters to set the positioning and height of new terrain

WARNING: This is less a power tool for valheim terrain generation, and more an industrial saw mill. It is completely capable of ruining the terrain on the entire world, with no safeguards. 

Check, for the love of god, your starting coords, and try it off comfy first. Ensure that the start and end coords in the generated file fall within sectors you have marked on the sheet.

Gustav, Gustavson & Sons accept no responsibility for any damage to comfy, your own world or your sanity caused by this tool.
